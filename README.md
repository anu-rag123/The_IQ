# The_IQ
- _THE I.Q. is a quiz type game in which there are two levels one is to complete the spaces and other is to pick the odd one out._
- _The game will start from LEVEL-1 which is to fill spaces.You have 5 seconds to answer a single question,type the answer using keyboard,if answer is right your score will increase by 10 and in case of wrong answer nothing is lost.There are 3 questions in 1st level.LEVEL-2 is all about to pick the odd one out.The rest is same as level 1st._
- _I have made it using C and C++._
